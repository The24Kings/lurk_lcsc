/// - The server will send this message to show the client changes to their player's status, such as in health or gold.
/// - The server will also use this message to show other players or monsters in the room the player is in or elsewhere.
/// - The client should expect to receive character messages at any time, which may be updates to the player or others.
/// - If the player is in a room with another player, and the other player leaves, a `PktType::CHARACTER` message should be sent to indicate this.
///   - In many cases, the appropriate room for the outgoing player is the room they have gone to.
/// - If the player goes to an unknown room, the room number may be set to a room that the player will not encounter (does not have to be part of the map).
///   - This could be accompanied by a narrative message (for example, "Glorfindel vanishes into a puff of smoke"), but this is not required.
/// - The client will use this message to set the name, description, attack, defense, regen, and flags when the character is created.
/// - It can also be used to reprise an abandoned or deceased character.
